This is a project that was inspired by my loved ones telling me that they didn't understand the subject matter of my thesis. This is a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) web app hosted on Google Cloud Run that uses my thesis as a source for LLM-generated answers to user prompts. 

The original thesis is included in this repository, but you can find it [here](https://www.utupub.fi/handle/10024/181576) as well. In this repository, you can also find scripts for converting the pdf file of your choice into vectorized data.

Enjoy!
